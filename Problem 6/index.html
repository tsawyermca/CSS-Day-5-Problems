        <p>Birds are born with no shackles
        <br>
        Then, what fetters my fate?
        <br>
        Blown away, the white petals
        <br>
        Leave me trapped in the cage
        <br>
        The endless isolation
        <br>
        Can't wear down my illusion
        <br>
        Someday, I'll make a dream unchained
        <br>
        Let my heart bravely spread the wings
        <br>
        Soaring past the night
        <br>
        To trace the bright moonlight
        <br>
        Let the clouds heal me of the stings
        <br>
        Gently wipe the sorrow off my life
        <br>
        I dream
        <br>
        What is meant by miracle
        <br>
        A word outside my days
        <br>
        Once again, repeat warbles
        <br>
        But how could I escape?
        <br>
        No further hesitation
        <br>
        On those unanswered questions
        <br>
        So now, I'll make a dream unchained
        <br>
        Let my heart bravely spread the wings
        <br>
        Soaring past the night
        <br>
        To chase the bright moonlight
        <br>
        Let the clouds heal me of the stings
        <br>
        Gently wipe the sorrow off my life
        <br>
        I dream
        </p>
